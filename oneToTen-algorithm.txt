1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): play a game where user will guess a number from 1 to 10

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-userGuess

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. game loop: prompt the userGuess, input userGuess, provide feedback
4. end of game	

[Notes: 
What do we test? and in what order do we test it?
user wants to exit game [userGuess =0]
invalid values [ valid values for userGuess = 1 to 10]
whether user guesses target [userGuess = target]
user guess incorrectly
]

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules: "I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 10. What is it? "
-prompt : "What is your guess [1-10 or 0 to Exit]? "
-guess feedback : "You guessed it!"
-error message : "I really want a number from 1 to 10."
-guess feedback: "Try again..."
-end of game message : "Thanks for playing oneToTen game with me!"

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-userGuess = (integer) each user guess of target number
-target = (integer) the number to be guessed

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data definition
10 set target = random number from 1 to 10 [make up a number, or use a random number generator...]
***user introduction 
20 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***game loop: prompt the userGuess, input userGuess, provide feedback
30 output prompt "What is your guess [1-10 or 0 to Exit]? "
40 input userGuess
50 if userGuess is equal to 0 then skip to instruction 140
60 if userGuess is greater than or equal to 1 and userGuess is less then or equal to 10 then skip instruction 90
70 output "I really want a number from 1 to 10."
80 skip to instruction 30
90 if userGuess is not equal to target then 120
100 output "You guessed it!"
110 skip to instruction 140
120 output "Try again..."
130 skip to instruction 30
***end of game 
140 output  "Thanks for playing oneToTen game with me!"
