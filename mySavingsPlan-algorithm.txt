1. Objective: calculate how much money to save every month for number of years before retirement and how much money would you have when you retire.

2. Requirements: 
--INPUT
deposit
interestRate

--PROCESSING
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. calculate amount of money to save every month
amountSaved = deposit * (((pow(1 + interestRate),time) - 1) / interestRate)
4. output results


--OUTPUT
-user introduction: objective, author, user instructions (if any)
-label "In " + years + "years at" + interestRate + "%,$" + deposit + " deposited per month will grow to $" + amountSaved 

--DATA
deposit-->> how much money you will add to your savings account each month (integer) author selected amount (for example $10, $100, etc.)
interestRate-->> annual interest rate you can expect (check google.com: for example 0.04 is 4%) (decimal) author selects annual interest rate (for example 0.075 is 7.5%)
years-->> how many more years until you retire (integer)
amountSaved-->> how much money you have when you retire (decimal) (formatted to 2 digits past decimal point)
time-->>number of months in years (integer)

3. Algorithm Instructions
***data definitions
10 set years = how many more years until you retire 
20 set deposit = how much $ to be saved each month
30 set interestRate = expected interest rate on deposit expressed as a number between 0 and 1
40 set interestRate = interestRate / 12
50 set time = years * 12
*** user introduction
60 output the user introduction (objective, author, and any user instructions)
*** calculate amount of money to save every month
70 set amountSaved = deposit * ((((1 + interestRate) ^ time) - 1) / interestRate)
80 set interestRate = (interestRate * 100) * 12
***output results
90 output "In " and years and " years at " and interestRate and "%, $" and deposit and " deposited per month will grow to $" and amountSaved
100 END

4. Test Cases
Test Case #1: 
purpose: example test case
input values: years=10, interestRate=7.5%, investment=$100
expected output: 
...
"In 10 years at 7.5% , $100 deposited per month will grow to $17793.03."


10 years = 10
20 deposit = 100 
30 interestRate = 7.5 / 100 = 0.075
40 interestRate = 0.075  / 12 = 0.00625
50 time = 10 * 12 = 120
60 Objective : calculate how much money to save every month for number of years before retirement and how much money would you have when you retire.
Author : Kevin Jaewoo Lee 1989282
70 amountSaved = 100 *(((( 1 + 0.00625) ^ 120 ) -1 ) / 0.00625 ) = 17793.03
80 interestRate = (0.00625 * 100) * 12 = 7.5
90 In 10 years at 7.5% , $100 deposited per month will grow to $17793.03
100 End
