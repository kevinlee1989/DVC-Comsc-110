1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): calculate the miles/gallon and depending on the capacity in gallons of the fuel tank calculate the range possible with the remaining fuel. 

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-fuelTankCapacity 
-gallonsUsed = 
-milesDriven = 

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. calculate the miles/gallon
4. depending on the capacity in gallons of the fuel tankbcalculate the range possible with the remaining fuel.
5. output results

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-prompt " Use this program at least you have driven your car. "
-label "mpg : " + mpg + "mi/g"
-label "range :" + range + "mi " 

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-fuelTankCapacity = The size of the container that stores fuel (decimal)  author selected the Capacity
-gallonsUsed = The amount of gallons you used (decimal) author selects how much gollons are used
-milesDriven = The distance of miles you have driven. (decimal) author selects how much miles they drove
-mpg = The fuel consumption level of a car (decimal)
-fuelRemaining = the amount of fuel remains (decimal)
-range = the amount of distance that you can drive for this year (decimal)
3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 set fuelTankCapacity = The size of the container that stores fuel
20 set gallonsUsed = The amount of gallons you used
30 set milesDriven = The distance of miles you have driven.
***introduction 
40 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
45 output prompt "Use this program at least you have driven your car. "
***calculate the miles/gallon and depending on the capacity in gallons of the fuel tank 
50 set mpg = milesDriven / gallonsUsed
***depending on the capacity in gallons of the fuel tankbcalculate the range possible with the remaining fuel.
60 set fuelRemaining = fuelTankCapacity - gallonUsed
70 set range = fuelRemaining * mpg
***output results
80 output "mpg : " and mpg and "mi/g"
90 output "range :" and range and "mi"

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1:
purpose : simple example
input values : fuelTankCapacity = 100.32, gallonsUsed = 45.67, milesDriven = 1000
expected result :
...
Instructions : Use this program at least you have driven your car.
mpg : 21.896212mi/g
range : 1196.627983mi

10 set fuelTankCapacity = 100.32
20 set gallonsUsed = 45.67
30 set milesDriven = 1000
40 output Objective : calculate the miles/gallon and depending on the capacity in gallons of the fuel tank calculate the range possible with the remaining fuel.
Author : Kevin Jaewoo Lee 1989282
Instructions : Use this program at least you have driven your car
50 set mpg = 1000 / 45.67 = 21.896212
60 set fuelRemaining = 100.32 - 45.67 = 54.65
70 set range = 54.65 * 21.896212 = 1,196.627983
80 output mpg : 21.896212mi/g
90 output range : 1196.62983mi

999 END

Test case #2: 
purpose : when user didnt drive a car 

In case user did not not move one's car I added a instruction that user must use this program after they drive their car.
