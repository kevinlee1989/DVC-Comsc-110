1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): play a game where the user guesses a number from 1 to 100 

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-userGuess

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. game loop: prompt the userGuess, input userGuess, provide feedback
4. end of game

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules: "I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 100. What is it? "
-prompt : "What is your guess [1-100 or 0 to Exit]? "
-guess feedback : "That's right -- it's target"
-guess feedback : "That's too high -- guess again"
-guess feedback : "That's too low -- guess again"
-error message : "I really want a number from 1 to 100."
-end of game message : "Thanks for playing overUnder game with me!"
-file output: "last player took " + count + " guesses to guess the correct number.";

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-userGuess = (integer) each user guess of target number
-target = (integer) the number to be guessed
-count = (integer) how many guesses user tried

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 set target = random number from 1 to 100 [make up a number, or use a random number generator...]
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules

30 output prompt "What is your guess [1-100 or 0 to Exit]? "
40input userGuess
45 add 1 to count
50 if userGuess is equal to 0 then skip to instruction 170
60 if userGuess is greater than or equal to and userGuess is less then or equal to 100 then skip to instruction 90
70 output "I really want a number from 1 to 100."
80 skip to instruction 30
90 if userGuess is not equal to target then 120
100 output "That's right -- it's target"
110 skip to instruction 163
120 if userGuess is less then target then skip to instruction 150
130 output prompt "That's too high -- guess again"
140 skip to instruction 30
150 output prompt "That's too low -- guess again"
160 skip to instruction 30
163 file output "last player took " + count + " guesses to guess the correct number."
***end of game
170 output "Thanks for playing overUnder game with me!"

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
Purpose: user selects to exit before guessing target
Inputs: target = 56, userGuess = 0
Expected Results: 
...
What is your guess [1-100 or 0 to Exit]? 0
Thanks for playing overUnder game with me!
