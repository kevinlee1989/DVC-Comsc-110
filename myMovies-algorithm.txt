1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): The program will Input any number of movie titles and year each movie was created from file movieData.txt and store on a list. 

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-userGuessYear
-userAnswer

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3.read input file and create a list
4.check whether the user guess right or wrong and ask to play it again or add another movie to the list
5.output sorted movie title and year

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-prompt : "Guess what year is " + movie[random].title +" movie was made? [valid input : numbers]: "
-feedback : " You guess it wrong! it was made in " + movie[random].year
-feedback : " You are correct! "
-prompt : "Do you want to play again or want to add another movie to the list? "
-error message : " I can not understand whether you want to play again or add another movie! " 
-label : movie[i].title + "  " + movie[i].year


DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-objective = (text) "The program will Input any number of movie titles and year each movie was created from file movieData.txt and store on a list.\n" //program objective
-instructions = (text) "Guess what year that movie was made only by numbers.\n\n" //user instructions 
-deque<Movies> movie = (collection) // create an empty collection 
-userGuessYear = (integer) // user guessing the year of the movie which is chosen by the random generator
-int result (integer) //determine whether they got the question right or wrong
-answer (character) //user answer whether they want to play again or add the another movie to the list 
- i (integer)//for index loop
-ifstream fin //for file input
-fileName = "movieData.txt" (text) //for open the file
-Movies amovie (structure) // updation a movie from input file 
-userGuessYear (integer) // user guessing the year of the movie which is chosen by the random generator
-result (integer) //determine whether user guess is right or wrong
-userAnswer (character) //user answer to play again or add another movie to the list
-resultAnswer (character) // value return to main function
-j (integer)// inner loop index
-swapy (integer) //used for sort swap
-string swapt (text) //used for sort swap
