1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): asks the questions and the score is incremented by 1 if the user answered a question correctly.

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-userAnswer

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. ask questions and determine whether it is correct or not

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-prompt : "What is it called as a data in computer programming language? "
-prompt : "How many number can you express by Binary Numbering System? [answer by number]"
-prompt : "What is not the requirment characteristic for programmar? a) passion b) Patience c) Lazy "
-incorrect message : " Incorrect, but a better answer would be " + a1
-correct message : "Correct!"
-label :  "That's " + correct + "out of 3 questions asked."

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-score= (integer) determine how many correct answer does user get?
-result = (bool) determine answer is false or true
-userAnswer = (string),(integer),(character) // different by different subprograms
-i = (integer) for question index

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)

3005 output prompt "Q." + i + "  " + question + "  ";
3010 input userAnswer from console
3011 if userAnswer is not c answer then skip to 3013
3012 userAnswer is C
3013 if userAnswer is not value or Value or Values then skip to 3015
3014 userAnswer is "values"
3015 if userAnswer is answer then skip to instruction 3018
3016 output " Incorrect, but a better answer would be " + answer
3017 skip to instruction 3020
3018 output "Correct!"
3019 result = true
3020 return from subprogram getquestion1 with result value


// algorithm for main

40 set question = "What is it called as a data in computer programming language? "

44 set i = 1
45 if getquestion if ture then add 1 to score
50 getquestion from subprogram

70 getquestion from subprogram
71 set question = "What is not the requirment characteristic for programmar? a) passion b) Patience c) Lazy ?"
72 set answer = C
73 set i = 3
80 if getquestion is true then add 1 to score 
90  output  "That's " + score + "out of 3 questions asked."
999 END
