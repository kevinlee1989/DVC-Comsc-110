1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): to calculate and output the number of weeks that it will take to reach a total of one thousand, million, billion dollars or greater.

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-week

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. calculate amount week to be what I want to be

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-prompt : "How many weeks do you need to be " + goal + ?";
-error message : "Invalid Input, I can not calculate"
-label : " no we need more time"
-label : "In " + week + " weeks, I will be a " + goal

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-week = (integer) how many weeks to save money
-amountSaved =(double) week saved money
-totalSaved = (double) amount all money user saved
-i = (integer) index loop
-goal = (string) thousand and million and billion
-g = (integer) amount number for string goal

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
//calculate amount week to be what I want to be
*** subprogram amountweek
1000 set week
1005 set goal
1010 set amountSaved
1020 set i
1030 set totalSaved

1050 if goal is "thousandaire" then g is 1000
1060 if goal is "millionaire" then g is 1000000
1070 if goal is "billionaire" then g is 1000000000
1080 ouput prompt  "How many weeks do you need to be " + goal + ?";
1090 input week
1100 totalSaved=0
1110 if week is greater than 0 skip to instruction 1125
1120 output error message  "Invalid Input, I can not calculate"
1123 skip to instruction 1080
1125 i = 1 
1126 when i is greater then week then skip to instruction1170
1130 amountSaved = 0.5 * (pow(2,(i-1)))
1140 totalSaved = totalSaved + amountSaved;
1150 add 1 to i
1160 skip to introduction 1130
1170 if totalSaved is greater than and equal to g then skip to 1120
1180 output " no we need more time"
1190 skip to instruction 1080
1120 output "In " + week + " weeks, I will be a " + goal
// main function
