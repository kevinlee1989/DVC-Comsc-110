1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): output the forecasted high temperatures for any 5-day period for a selected city

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-day1Temp
-day2Temp
-day3Temp
-day4Temp
-day5Temp
-day1Date
-day2Date
-day3Date
-day4Date
-day5Date

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. assign values for each of the 5 days high temperatures
4. output the forecasted high temperatures for those 5 days

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-label : "city name, California forecast high temperatures:"
-For each of the 5 days : day of week, month/date,degrees F, " degrees"
-label : "source: ..." [where this data came from]


DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-city = (text) name of the selected city and state
-day1Temp = ( integer ) 1st day's high temperature in the city we selected as measured in degrees Farenheit
-day2Temp = ( integer ) 2nd day's high temperature in the city we selected as measured in degrees Farenheit
-day3Temp = ( integer ) 3rd day's high temperature in the city we selected as measured in degrees Farenheit
-day4Temp = ( integer ) 4th day's high temperature in the city we selected as measured in degrees Farenheit
-day5Temp = ( integer ) 5th day's high temperature in the city we selected as measured in degrees Farenheit
-day1Date = (text) day of the week, month and day
-day2Date = (text) day of the week, month and day
-day3Date = (text) day of the week, month and day
-day4Date = (text) day of the week, month and day
-day5Date = (text) day of the week, month and day
