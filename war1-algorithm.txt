1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): to play the card game war

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-answer

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. set random number to the values
4. determine suit of the cards
5. determine who is the winner

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-prompt "Computer's card is a " + computerCardvalue + " of " + computerCardsuit
-prompt "Human's card is a " + playerCardvalue + " of " + playerCardsuit
-label : "Computer wins : " + countC + "," + " Human wins: " + countU
-feedback "It's a tie. "
-feedback "Humans wins!"
-feedback "Computer wins!"

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-cardValue = (integer) determine the number of card
-cardSuit = (integer) determine the shape of card
-answer = (character) user answer to choose whether to stop the program or not
-countC = (integer) determine computer win
-countU + (integer) determine user win
