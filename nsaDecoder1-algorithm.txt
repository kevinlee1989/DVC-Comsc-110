1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-r

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. read input file
4. encode the sentence
5. output result

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-label : " File was empty . "
-instruction : "Decode the entered text so that each character is converted to the next character in the ASCII code. That is, convert 'B' to 'A', '5' to '4', '+' to '*', etc. So the word Ifmmp will appear as Hello in decoded form. Remember a line of text contains multiple characters, and each character has an ASCII value, and by subtracting 1 to that ASCII value results in the next character in the ASCII table.
-prompt : "Enter a line of text:";

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-string objective = "The program will be a template for C++ programs and to test code.\n"; //program objective
-string instructions = "Decode the entered text so that each character is converted to the next character in the ASCII code. That is, convert 'B' to 'A', '5' to '4', '+' to '*', etc. So the word Ifmmp will appear as Hello in decoded form. Remember a line of text contains multiple characters, and each character has an ASCII value, and by subtracting 1 to that ASCII value results in the next character in the ASCII table..\n\n"; //user instructions 
-int i; //index loop
-ifstream fin; //fin
-int count = 0; // determine whether file is empty
-int r; //user wanted line
-string first;
-string second;
-string third;
-string forth;
-string secret = "secret.txt"; //output file
